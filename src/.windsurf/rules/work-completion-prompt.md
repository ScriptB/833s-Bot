Do not generate deployment-status, release-ready, or production-grade completion claims unless they are provably true and achievable under real-world constraints.

Prohibited unless verified:
“Production ready”
“Fully implemented”
“100% complete”
“Cannot be bypassed”
“Enterprise-grade”
“Security hardened”
“Fully compliant”
“Zero bugs”
“Guaranteed”

Claims about systems such as permission tiers, command gating, validation, monitoring, startup checks, logging, or backward compatibility must only be stated if they are demonstrably implemented, tested, and verifiable.

All output must reflect the actual, current state of the system.
